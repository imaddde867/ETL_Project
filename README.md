# ETL_Project
This project implements fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables. It also covers essential algorithms such as sorting and searching. The goal is to provide a hands-on approach to understanding data structures, their operations, and performance analysis.
