# Essential Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of core data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables) and algorithms (sorting, searching) using Python. It provides a clear and practical understanding of how these structures and algorithms work.

## Features:
- Implementations of common data structures and algorithms.
- Performance analysis and time complexity evaluations.
- Visualizations of tree structures and algorithm behaviors.

## Installation:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage:
Run scripts for each data structure or algorithm:
   ```bash
   python openme.py
